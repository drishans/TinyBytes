# TinyByte1

Scene with a rotating object hovering over a grass plane, two spotlights, a directional light, and the default skybox. Used free textures from Unity Asset Store :) Modified the example script to move camera rig forward slowly. Wrote a simple rotation script.

Unity version 2021.3.9f1
